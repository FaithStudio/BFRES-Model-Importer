# BFRES-Model-Importer
A script that will inject and replace models from a BFRES file.

This originally was by smb123w64gb however since it's not being updated I decided to help maintain it. 
Script includes many further improvements and also more to come soon. Feel free to contribute!

* Supports both Nintendo Switch and Wii U games
* Imports models aslong as they are under the polycount of the original model. 

## Requirements
* Python 2.7 or higher (lower versions untested)

## Todo
* Tanget and binormal calculation. Normal maps won't work well without these!
* Material editing
* Bounding box calculation



### Credits
* Smb123w64gb which made the original tool.
